				</p>
				<h5 class="mt-5">
					Step 2
				</h5>
				<p>
					On the way to our happiness, it’s natural that you can hesitate how to behavior in communication, if you can fit to this or that lady and what still to do the lady you like pay attention on you. At this stage, a <a href="https://bridgematchmaker.com/member/personal_matchmaker.php">Personal matchmaker</a> will be added to you, who will help you to dispel these and other doubts and tell you in which direction to move to your second half.

				</p>
				<h5 class="mt-5">
					Step 3
				</h5>
				<p>
					Our matchmakers always ready to help you and share advice which will help you to meet the right lady. In order for your matchmaker will be easier to select profiles of ladies, we ask you to fill in <a href="https://bridgematchmaker.com/member/profile_about_me.php">More information about you</a> .
				</p>
				<p>
					Filling in profile on our website, imagine you prepare for real date. Be honest, answering on the questions of our profile, upload several of your real photos that the ladies know what man they are talking with.  From the honesty of filling out your profile directly depends the first impression of a lady about you
				</p>
				<h5 class="mt-5">
					Step 4 
				</h5>
				<p>
					After you come through first 3 steps, you can meet with profile of ladies. Do not rush to get upset if in your cabinet  in section <a href="https://bridgematchmaker.com/member/gallery.php?view=gallery">Women Profiles</a>  you don’t find profile of ladies. For each client, we select an individual search program and after talking with the matchmaker, you will have access to the profiles of girls			
				</p>
				<h5 class="mt-5">
					Step 5
				</h5>
				<p>
					And after you have completed the important steps on our website, verified your profile and answered the questions of our profile, your matchmaker will start working on the selection of girls according to your criteria. Please be patient, as in the process of selection we try to consider all your criteria and preferences in the search and there is need some time. You can see profile of ladies recommended your matchmaker in section <a href="https://bridgematchmaker.com/member/gallery.php?view=recomendation ">Matchmaker’s recommendations</a> . 
				</p>
				<h5 class="mt-5">
					Step 6
				</h5>
				<p>
					So, now you can meet with ladies, your personal matchmaker selected for you. And would like to pay your attention at once, the ladies of our website can’t write letters to you and show activity. You make the first step and only you.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you like someone from the recommended ladies, show courage and write to her, tell her a little about yourself. Ladies like brave men, and thus you will open for her the opportunity to write to you.If you still hesitate, you can receive the answer of a lady on one of 30 questions, we asked her. If the lady gave the answer, in her profile will display a button  "Ask me your question"
				</p>			
				<h5 class="mt-5">
					Step 7
				</h5>
				<p>
					In order to get to know your lady better, you can not only write a letter to her, but also use such a service as the Video Conference.
				</p>
				<p>
					We believe that by inviting a girl to a Video conference you are one step closer to a real meeting. And your matchmaker may be present during the conference so that you and your lady feel more confident during the conversation.
				</p>
				<p>
					We wish you a pleasant communication on our website  and we hope these  steps will bring you closer to the desired result. If you have questions, you can always ask them to your <a href="https://bridgematchmaker.com/member/personal_matchmaker.php">Personal matchmaker</a>
