We use the progressive method of estimating the compatibility coefficients, at the same time dozens of criteria are analyzed (common values, interests and preferences, hobbies, lifestyle, and much more). We will significantly save your time and form a narrow circle of your potential partners, but choice is yours to make. All matches (meetings) pass through creative decisions, are checked repeatedly, temporary entrainments and encouragement of long-term communications are eliminated. Only after careful and serious work we provide useful advice for both parties. We are ready to improve our process and prepare you for the next match.
